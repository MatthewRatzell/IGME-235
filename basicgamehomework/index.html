<p> April O'Neil, the reporter friend of the <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i>, is kidnapped by the villainous Shredder and his two goons, Bebop and Rocksteady.<br>
     The four ninja turtles: Raphael, Michelangelo, Donatello and Leonardo fight their way through hordes of Foot Soldiers in order to rescue April. <br>
     They battle familiar foes such as the mad scientist Baxter Stockman, General Traag from Dimension X and the evil alien brain Krang, up to the final showdown with Shredder himself.<br> 
     <i>Teenage Mutant Ninja Turtles</i> is an arcade game made by Konami during the height of the cartoon series' popularity. Depending on the version of the game,<strong> up to two, three or four players</strong> can take part in the action.<br>
    The game plays like a simplified Double Dragon. While most of the standard Foot Soldier enemies are easily dispatched, some attack with knives or ray guns and are thus more dangerous.<br>
     At the end of each level, players encounter a boss (or in certain cases two bosses working in tandem, such as Bebop and Rocksteady).</p>
